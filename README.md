# battleArenaPythonGame

This is a simple randomized game I created as a project during my bootcamp course for python.
The script works by pulling and randomizing custom objects for use in the battle game.
Game play is as simple as choosing '1, 2, 3' and reading the flavor text.
There is an element of strategy, as you have to concider your health versus the monster. 
Altogether it is simplistic, but I added a bit of flair, as there is 1 instant KO weapon for every monster.
